Please cite the journal article rather than this git repository when referencing this work. (This repository may not exist forever).

Three versions of the model are included, each with a different utility pricing structure (see article for description of the differences between the pricing structures). 

An example input file for Los Angeles, CA, USA is included in two formats: 'csv' and 'xlsx'. Stella will allow importing of the .csv format. The .xlsx file contains comments that provide more detailed descriptions of the input parameters. It is recommended that the user adapt all of the input parameters to their location.
